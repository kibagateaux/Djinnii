Ideas
  How to incorporate dietary habits into game?
    Does how they feed imaginary Djinn reflect how they feed themmselves?
    Ping them at "eating' times and ask to be fed what player is eating, only works if we know theyre eating habits or they follow general pattern
    Health stats affect both character and activity stats


Make more gamy / active:
  find a genie sprite or something to make it seem less like a real person
  turn activity into stats, avg calories / day = stamina, total time active per week = intelligence, etc
  Djinn gets restless if 1 hour without Moves API notif so they tells you to bring them for a walk
  "Feed" it with cake, meat, fruit which affect health stats
  Rewarded for going to new places in the world
  Adapt it into existing games like soccer. Each player is wearing their Djinn on their arm, playing like a regular game. E.g. They have all paired to say they are playing together. Random timer (or goal) happens and Djinns notify players of rule/team/objective change in the game. 
  App pings you motivationally during exercise. "Your Djinn is working out too, blah blah blah, yay teamwork!" 

$ "Play Day" serves 2 functions:
  Review each event and alter stats table, etc
  Educate user on their activity lifecycles

  Seriously need to normalize data structures on backend // Do this in leiu of ^^^
